This was a test to see if I could create a repository on the web interface.  After creating it I used the clone button to get the code for the repository.  

Once I got the code, i was able to run the "clone" tag with the copied text in order to create a local copy on my machine.

I used ls, pwd, cd to access the repo folder which we created in another exercise.
